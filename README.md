# Finally, a subprocess type that streams out stdout/stderr easily

Capturing the stderr AND stdout from a process in python is not that easy.
This class makes this capturing much easier by delegating the line capturing
to seperate threads. This capture can be totally in memory or can optionally
be streamed to a output stream such as a file handle.

This class will unconditionally launch a shell command and the input will always
be string, not an array like what is accepted by subprocess.Popen().

# Example:

Super simple example:

```
out_stream = StringIO()
p = CapturingProcess("echo hi", stdout=out_stream)
p.wait()
self.assertIn("hi", out_stream.getvalue())
self.assertIn("hi", p.get_stdout())
```

For splitting the output to stdout and a file you'd write a stream class like so:

```
class MyStream:
    def __init__(self, filehandle) -> None:
        self.fh = filehandle

    def write(self, data: str) -> None:
        self.fh.write(data)
        sys.stdout.write(data)
```

Then compose:

```
with open('myfile', 'w') as fd:
    out_stream = MyStream(fd)
    proc = CapturingProcess("echo hi", stdout=out_stream)
    proc.wait()  # Output will go to file and sys.stdout
```


To silence an output stream (stdout/stderr) drop a StringIO object as an argument to
the CapturingProcess like so:

```
proc = CapturingProcess("echo hi", stdout=StringIO())
proc.wait()  # stdout redirected to StringIO()
```


# Python version: 3.6+

Because of the use of type annotations, this library is not compatible with python 2.7
However you are free to strip out these type annotations and this project *should* work
pretty well.
